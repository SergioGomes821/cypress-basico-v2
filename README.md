This projetc `CYPRESS-BASICO-V2Â´ there are any basic test about CAC TAT application present in 
src index.html.

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v16.13.2` and `8.1.2` of Node.js and npm, respectively.
> **Note:**: I not recomend using last node version, because this projetc can't working, because the cypress structure changed.

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.
